# NOTE:
All scripts in this repository are open sources scripts that are converted <br>
by us or our community to work with the DokusCore Framework. These plugins <br>
are *NOT* build by the DokusCore team, and all credits to the plugins go <br>
to each individual creator. We mainly tested those posted in Discord to <br>
be working, safe to use, and packed it within this repository for quick <br>
and easy installment. We do not support none DokusCore plugins, so all <br>
these plugins are used at your own discretion!
